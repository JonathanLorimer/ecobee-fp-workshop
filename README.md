If you don't have typescript installed
```
npm install -g typescript
```

I **strongly** encourage using [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) along with the [tslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin) plugin because of first-class support by microsoft.

You can use your favourite editor, and just use the tsc compiler for feedback if you wish.

Clone the repo
```
git clone git@github.com:JonathanLorimer/ecobee-fp-workshop.git
cd ecobee-fp-workshop/project
npm install

npm run build:dev
```
